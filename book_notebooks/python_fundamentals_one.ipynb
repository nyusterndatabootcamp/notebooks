    "    * Lists. Lists are collections of things in square brackets: [1, 'help', 3.14159].\n",
    "    * Number types: integers vs. floats. Examples of integers include -1, 2, 5, 42. They cannot involve fractions. Floats use decimal points: 12.34. Thus 2 is an integer and 2.0 is a float.\n",

    "    * Use `list()` to convert a string to a list of its characters.\n",

    "* **Error message types**:\n",
    "    * NameError. Usually happens when using something not defined which could be variable or methods.\n",
    "    * TypeError. Raise when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. For example, tuples have no `\"=\"` methods while number no `len`.   \n",
    "    * Invalid syntax. Syntax errors can be detected before your program begins to run. So first thing to do is to check typos, parentheses, etc.\n",
